         <section>
  <p><strong>2025/5/19</strong> - Look baby, we both know this is the first day we started talking, and its crazy looking back at it.<br>
  Its started from this stupid joke right? Just us being silly. But all the coincidences, or what i'd like to call sign now,<br>
  had to mean something. And i'm glad they did, it all made me realize how alike we are, and made us interested in talking to eachother more.</p>

  <p><strong>2025/5/23</strong> - This is the day we had our first like real private conversation,it started in the general chat at like 7 am when u were typing there,<br>
  and the dm itself, i know it started because u were listening to the song "is there free breakfast here" by hotel ugly and the day before that i showed u some of his songs.<br>
  so seeing you listen to it made me react to it on discord, and then you asked if i'd give my playlist, you gave yours, and it kept going, even as you were in school<br>
  Thats also the day we lowkey trolled von by ignoring him, and then it became this whole thing with ida where we trolled her into apoligizing, when u said "you're evil, i love it"<br>
  I knew you were the one :P<br>
  We kept talking for so long, you sent those voice messages and i was already in love with your voice but i couldnt mention it of course, and then i sent the vm of me trying to say tanga i gues... :'D<br>
  And we just had some serious conversations, and u kept texting me while you were out and it felt special, even tho i wanted you to have fun with your friends over texting, i wasnt complaining.<br>
  And then when i knew i felt something for real the first time, is when you were walking home and i was genuinely worried, at the time for a stranger, and i needed that "i got home safe" message from you.<br>
  And i got that message, and we decided to just text and stay up, at the end of the day it was like a 22 hour non stop, texting session, its really something else :D</p>

  <p><strong>2025/5/24</strong> - This is the day after, i told bolt about how much chemistry and how much alike we have, the way we texted texted for 22 hrs, and how it only stopped bcuz u accidentally fell asleep.<br>
  this guy just started teasing me with it in dms i remember, and then you texted me good morning when you woke up, i felt so happy inside and i couldnt explain why, you probably realized along the way that i liked you.<br>
  When i found that new chat background feature, and put your options on the wheel, i may or may not have re-spun the wheel, just so we get the "love" one, because i thought it was cute... ehm.. yeah.<br>
  Its also the day when we all the people joined vc and i joined them too, and for hourssss i tried to get you to join, and you didnt, but the truth is i was so nervous for you to join, and i couldnt even understand why back then :D<br>
  Also the day that when we were joking around with the hongdae guy thing, and i asked for your ig and you gave it to me, i saw you there and i couldnt believe that i have so much in similar, with that pretty girl &lt;3<br>
  And then somehow we got to the convo, where i asked you if i could download our convo into a txt file and ask chatgpt whats going on with all the signs, and it said something something about that this might develop into something romantic<br>
  but i didnt send you that part because i didnt want to make you feel like i was only talking to you with that interest, i was talking to you since i just really really enjoy talking to you, you are my soulmate, we are so alike in everyway,<br>
  yet we compliment eachother so well, you make me feel like my flaws are not flaws, they are a part of me and you accept them, i love you.</p>

  <p><strong>2025/5/25</strong> - This is the day when you named those two songs that you said remind you of me, wouldve been you, and destroy myself just for you.<br>
  And i asked bolt what that meant and he instantly guessed that it was you saying it, i couldnt stop listening to wouldve been you, it felt t ruly special after you said i remind you of it.<br>
  And then i said something like "maybe i'll make you a playlist tomorrow" and you were like "maybe that would be my favourite playlist oat, you'd listen to it everyday" but then i needed to<br>
  test the waters... i said something like "i only listen to love songs" And you said "i love love songs" And i asked u if it was okay if i put love songs in there and you were okay with it<br>
  and thats when i got really nervous, i wanted to make it special, i hope you liked it, i wanted the time to feel special too thats why i made it 1 hour 4 minutes, adding up to 5, and the songs being 19,<br>
  so it would come out to the date of 5/19. This is also the day that u gave that first paragraph for me, after i jokingly said "so u hate me" and then u said i have something in mind to prove that i dont<br>
  and then later you sent me it, and it meant so much i said it almost made me cry, and its true, i was only holding it back bcuz ppl were around me :D<br>
  After that bolt wanted to vc, since the day before u agreed to join us, and then u started hating on your own voice and i STILL CANT BELIVE THAT??? like your voice is perfect, you sound like an angel, i want to listen to it everyday.<br>
  But at the end of the day its the end of the day (sorry i love you, i had to add it somewhere) and you joined vc, even tho you didnt talk when everyone was there. You probably heard how nervous i was<br>
  and you kept complimenting my voice and giggle and it just kept making me more nervous, i couldnt stop smilinggg you were KILLING MEEEE. After everyone left we decided that we'd both speak,<br>
  but the way we just giggled for like 30 mins straight, i felt the tension through the screen, and angel joined in, adding fuel to the fire by saying "they are just giggling, they are flirting" i was dyingggggg :D<br>
  And then bolt was coming back from his outing at like 3 am or whatever, and he was texting us like "im back in 20 get all the cheesy corny shit out the way, if you dont wanna get teased" and then he did come, and he did tease,<br>
  i acted like i didnt like it , but i loved that shittt :P And after that we stayed on call while we slepttt it was the first time i did something like that and i LOVED it, waking up and knowing u were on the other end of the call it felt great.</p>

  <p><strong>2025/5/26</strong> - I woke up early after getting my brother ready for kindergarten and then i started playing some games with kai, she joined vc and u were sleeping and i was just playing with her normally, talking.<br>
  And then you woke uppppp you texted and i instantly got soooo nervous that i stopped talking as muchhhhh, and then when you started to speak too, even kaiii said she was nervous to speak, you just have that pressence i love ittttt.<br>
  Okay and thenn von somehow got into the vc too right, and me and him started playing arsenal, and then you kinda dissapearedd, and then texted me later, and then u sent me that record of u singing sailor song.<br>
  I've been listening to it ever since, im gonna cherish it forever, its so attractive the way you play the guitar, your mannerisms, your voice, the cute ending, i cant stop listening to it, im addicted to it, to you.<br>
  And than this is that one dayy, where u joined vc with angie, still dk what u guys really talked about, but i told vondelor and xavier to let me win because it was a bet, you told me you'd sing another song.<br>
  BUT BOTH THESE BITCHES STARTED PLAYING MORE SERIOUSLY, BUT I SOMEHOW STILL BEAT THEIR BITCHASSES, i was soooo nervous i wanted to win so bad :'D<br>
  And then angel typed in general, tagging people saying "kihoto and angie are together" and everyone started dming me, congrats, we saw it coming, is it truee? stuf like this and we didnt stop it, i lowkey enjoyed it.<br>
  And then you were singing in vc as you were getting ready to go to the cinema. I know at the end of the day, this was the reason why ken and you got into a fight and ended up breaking up, im still sorry for that, i didnt mean to do that to you guys.<br>
  But if i'm being honest, i dont regret doing a single thing, even if that makes me sound like a jerk rn. After u said ure gonna watch stitch, and told me to speak my mind, i did.<br>
  I put everything out there and instead of judging me you answered everything in the best way possible.You also got mad when i was talking bad about myself, and you probably without realizing wrote "i love you for your personality not your looks"<br>
  I noticed it, you said you love me first, and even in that deep and emotional conversation we were having, my heart was about to explode after seeing that.But then you started naming reasons why you are not good for me,<br>
  and i just didnt understand why, i told you "You could name a million flaws, and it still wouldnt be enough to make me run away, im staying". Thats true. I want all of you, bad and good. I love you.<br>
  The whole time i was listening to you singing sailor song on reapeat, lowkey crying, these moments just meant so much.<br>
  You said you needed time to heal, i respected it, asked if you wanna go back to speaking like we did before, and just like that we flipped a switch,<br>
  it was back to the eyerolling playful way of talking and i was so relieved. And then after i while in this convo, i told you that i love you too, and we ended up sleepcalling again it was great, but we clearly didnt call it anything, even tho we said i love you.</p>

  <p><strong>2025/5/27</strong> - I woke up , texted u goodmorning, hope you smile when waking up and are feeling better, tty when u wake up, i love you.<br>
  And you responded with, hai, i missed you, i love you too ig.. :'D That was the best thing ever to wake up to, i still dont believe all this is happening to me to this day.<br>
  And you said you did smthng while i was sleeping, and then u showed me the playlist u made me, OMG i love it so much baby. Thank you for it, i will cherrish it till the day i die.<br>
  Then u agreed to join me and my cousin in our vc, that idiot realized u were there and i told him ure the girl i like and he started teasing, but u didnt understand :D<br>
  And while me and him were vcing and playing, u recorded the other song youll be in my heart by nikki. And you said "its not my best and its long" But hearing you sing those lyrics to me<br>
  i cant explain how good that makes me feel. And again your cute mannerisms, when u stopped in the middle, and like giggled that one time in it, its so AHHHHHHH you know? I love you so much<br>
  On this night we decided that we'd match pfps, and before u went to sleep i said in call that i love you, and you made me say it multiple times.... bobo.<br>
  But whenever i hear u say it my heart skips a beat, its something truly special i cant explain, you are my everythingggggg.</p>

  <p><strong>2025/5/28</strong> - yesterday YAAY!!! Woke up in the morning, u txted me while i was getting my brother ready for kindergarten, and then u went to school, i was listening to the playlist u made me in the shower i love it so muchhhhh<br>
  Then i went to take a nap and dreamt about you singing the song "fall in love with you" and i started walking towards you and i woke uppppp AHHHHHHHHHHH<br>
  But it was great, your voice, your pressence in my dream, feels just like in real life. Because i still think this is all a dream, i cant believe this is actually real, i love you.<br>
  Also vondelor this day, texted me "do you ever sleep" and i was like "yea i just woke up, we went to sleep at 1 am not even late" without even noticing i said WE instead of I, its crazyy :D<br>
  And then you mentioned me not being in the server as much as i usually am and ur right, i just wanted to focus on you every second of the day and i still do, but i will stay mindful and more active with the other people too, they are my friends afterall,<br>
  so thank you for calling me out, you make me a better person with everything you do. And then this is the day, where you told me "hope u dont mind that i used your name to tell someone to fuck off cause they keep insisting on wanting to see my face" And u sent me the screenshots,<br>
  and he asked "is that your boyfriend" and you replied yeah. And then i saw it as a chance to ask you if that means that youre officially my girlfriend now?<br>
  And yes it happened, i asked you, would you be my girlfriend and you said yes. I will never forget this date. 2025/5/25, lets go until that first 25 turns into 75 atleast.</p>
